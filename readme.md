<h1 align="center">Travel Blog</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://natashacmyers.github.io/trave-blog/)

This is a website for hosting a Travel Blog. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices,
making it easy to navigate for all users.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and easily navigate through to find content.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to register a new account.
    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to post a new blog.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to log in.
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to delete my blog(s).
    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to edit my blog(s).

  - #### Frequent User Goals
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to search for older posts.
    2. As a Frequent User, I want to search for new blogs based on countries I may wish to visit.
    3. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to log out and switch users.

- ### Design
  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The main colour scheme is the based around nature. I have used sky blues and olive greens to keep the theme as natural as possible.
    - I have chosen to keep the background plain for easy reading, but the header is a sky picture to capture the eye and excite the user
      about travelling.
  - #### Typography
    - The Comfortaa font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case
      for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Comfortaa is a clean and informal font, which
      is appropriate for an travel blog site. The easy-to-read friendly look is inviting and creates a great UX.
  - #### Imagery
    - The main image used on this screen is in the header. This creates and eye-catching bold statement piece. The second image is the map,
      which is a [Google Geochart API map](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart), is a simplistic and easy
      to understand. 
  - #### Hamburger Menu

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals

  1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn how to play the memory game.

     1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath here is a Welcome paragaph.
     2. The Welcome paragraph explains clearly the use of the site and how to play the game.
     3. The game is simple to use, with clear and easy to use buttons, the user will understand how to play the game very quickly.

  2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content and play the game.

     1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
     2. The game itself is designed with large buttons, the scores are in large text and easily visible whilst playing the game.
     3. The welcome paragraph highlights clearly the rules of the game so the user is clear on how to win and lose.

  3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look be able to contact the developer with feedback.
     1. The new user is able to navigate to the contact page easily.
     2. The contact page is simplistic with an easy-to-find contact form filling most of the page.
     3. The contact form is clear and easy to use. The user will be able to easily choose the topic of 'feedback' and message the developer, the message will be sent directly to the developer's mailbox.

- #### Returning Visitor Goals

  1. 1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to beat my topscore at the game.

     1. The game is easy to find, especially for returning users.
     1. The topscore is clearly visible under the game itself and will automatically populate with the highest score when the player wins or loses.

  2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the developer with questions about the code.

     1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
     2. Here they can fill out the form on the page.
     3. The user can easily select 'Contact the developer' from the drop down box and send a custom message which will be sent directly to the developer's mailbox, with information about how to contact the user.

- #### Frequent User Goals

  1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new updates or amendments to the game.

     1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily access the game to see for any updates.
     2. In the case of any major updates, a small updates box would be added to the home page in red font to announce the updates to the game, which would stand out as a change to the page to a frequent user.

  2. As a Frequent User, I want to complete the game.

     1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily play the game as normal.
     2. The win function would allow the user to gain a topscore of 20, and reset the game to play again.

  3. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to contact the developer with ideas and improvements for the game.

     1. The user would already be comfortable navigating to the contact us page to fill in the contact form.
     2. The user can then fill in the contact form as usual and select 'Ideas for improvements' from the drop down menu. Upon submission the message will be send directly to the developer's mailbox.

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

- As the page gets smaller the flower elements became relatively too small to use. Therefore I have used a larger scale for smaller screen sizes.
  - This results in an obvious change in size of elements at 1200px screens.
- On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, the flash element is less salient to the user. But still works well enough to play the game.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/natashacmyers/memorygame)
